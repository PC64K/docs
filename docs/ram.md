# RAM
RAM is used for temporary storage of both programs and arbitrary data. It is initialized by BIOS which copies the operating system or the required program to RAM, starting from `0x0000` and then starts executing opcodes starting from `0x0000`. Thus, no reading from storage is required at runtime unless reading/writing additional data.
